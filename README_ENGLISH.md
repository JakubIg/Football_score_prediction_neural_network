## Introduction
The problem of predicting the outcome of a football match is quite complex. Many factors influence the final result. Human intuition suggests that factors such as the current form of individual players, the place where the team is playing the game (in their own stadium or away) or the current position in the league have a significant influence on the outcome of the game. However, sometimes a person, despite his or her ignorance, also takes into account such aspects as the liking of a given team or player/coach. This is usually the wrong approach. In this work, the possibilities of artificial neural networks will be used to predict the final outcome of the match. The advantage of such a solution is the computing capabilities of current computers, which together with the appropriate implemented neural network are able to solve complex problems. The approach proposed in the work will consist in introducing into the neural network factors showing the achievements of the team in previous matches, and then on the basis of these data the network will detect the relationship between them and the final result of the meeting.  
## Data
For the project we used data for the English Premier League (http://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php), specifically the 2017/2018 season. 20 football clubs were playing together this season. For each clash between them, the database contains match statistics in the form of goals scored, goals lost, the number of corner kicks or the number of burned ones, among others.  
## Library
The project uses the "neuralnet" library, available in the program R. This package allows to build a neural network and teach it.
